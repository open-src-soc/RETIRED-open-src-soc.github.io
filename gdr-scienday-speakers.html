<h2 id="first-step-towards-a-made-in-europe-high-performance-microprocessor">European Processor Initiative: First step towards a made-in-Europe high-performance microprocessor</h2>
<p>By <strong>Denis Dutoit</strong>, <a href="https://www.leti-cea.com">CEA LETI</a></p>
<p>The European Processor Initiative (EPI) is a project funded by the European Commission, whose aim is to design and implement a roadmap for a new family of low-power European processors for extreme scale computing, high-performance Big-Data and a range of emerging applications. The project started in December 2018 and aims to deliver a high-performance, low-power processor, implementing ARM based general purpose processors and RISC-V based specific accelerators. The EPI processor will also meet high security and safety requirements. This will be achieved through intensive use of simulation, development of a complete software stack and tape-out in the most advanced semiconductor process node.</p>
<p>After an introduction on High Performance Computing new challenges and associated technology/architecture evolution, the presentation will highlight the EPI position statement on generic computing, accelerator with RISC-V and design methodology. The presentation will end with EPI’s roadmap towards a wide range of applications from Exascale computing to embedded HPC.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-space-industry-expect-from-risc-v">What does the space industry expect from RISC-V?</h2>
<p>By <strong>Antoine Certain</strong>, Airbus Defence &amp; Space</p>
<p>The space industry has some particularities which makes the usage of COTS components quite difficult. But, with the emergence of new space designs based on COTS, the space industry open its doors to a bigger ecosystem. And the RISC V ecosystem could answer to the major requirements of spacecraft design. This presentation will present the main requirements such industry expect from a core IP.</p>
<p><em>Antoine CERTAIN is an experienced hardware and software architect on embedded data-handling applications on spacecraft. He has gained large scale of space knowledge thanks to several projects for ESA, CNES and internally to Airbus Defence and Space.

<h2 id="achieving-determinism-and-performance-on-the-risc-v-flexpret-processor">Achieving determinism and performance on the RISC-V FlexPRET Processor</h2>
<p>By <strong>Eric Jenn</strong>, <a href="http://www.irt-saintexupery.com/">IRT Saint-Exupéry</a></p>
<p>Performance improvement usually comes at the cost of temporal determinism. Trading better average performance for a loss of predictability is sometimes acceptable, but it is not for safety-critical applications where the time at which a value is produced is often as important as the value itself. In this talk, we address the question of temporal determinism, which is a prerequisite to dependability. We show how we combine a deterministic programming model with a deterministic hardware architecture and an “holistic” optimization process to achieve both performance and dependability. This work is applied on the MultiPRET processor, a &quot;multicore&quot; declination of the RiscV FlexPRET PREcision Timed Architecture (PRET) proposed by the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
<p><em>Dr Eric Jenn is a research engineer at Thales AVS. He is currently managing the Critical Applications on Predictable High-Performance Computing Architectures (CAPHCA) collaborative research project at IRT Saint-Exupéry in Toulouse. Dr Jenn has been working in the area of safety critical systems for around 30 years, both on the analysis and development of nuclear and avionics systems.

<h2 id="tba-2">RISC-V based Virtual Prototype: An Open Source Platform for Modeling and Verification</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~grosse/">Daniel Große</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.uni-bremen.de">University of Bremen</a> and <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/">DFKI GmbH</a></p>
<p>We propose an open source RISC-V based Virtual Prototype (VP) under MIT license, available at <a href="http://www.systemc-verification.org/riscv-vp"><code>http://www.systemc-verification.org/riscv-vp</code></a>. Our VP is implemented in standard compliant SystemC using a generic bus system with TLM 2.0 communication. Our VP provides a 32 and 64 bit RISC-V core with different privilege levels, the RISC-V CLINT and PLIC interrupt controllers and an essential set of peripherals. It supports simulation of (mixed 32 and 64 bit) multi-core platforms and provides SW debug and coverage measurement capabilities. We support FreeRTOS, Zephyr and Linux operating systems. Our VP allows a significantly faster simulation compared to RTL, while being more accurate than existing ISSs. The VP has been designed as configurable and extensible platform. For example we provide the configuration for the RISC-V HiFive1 board from SiFive.</p>
<p><em>Daniel Große is a Senior Researcher at the University of Bremen and the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) Bremen, Germany.

<h2 id="formal-verification-of-riscv-implementation-designs">Formal Verification of RISC-V Implementation Designs</h2>
<p>By <strong>Romain Soulat</strong>, <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/global/innovation/research-and-technology">Thales Research &amp; Technology</a></p>
<p>Formal verification of hardware designs is a classical application of model checking in industry. RISC-V cores can be formally verified for functional correctness and framework already exist to automatically perform that kind of verification. When designs includes safety or security mechanisms, special additional verification requirements can be added to formally verify that those mechanisms performs correctly against threats or feared events.</p>
<p><em>Romain Soulat is working at Thales Research and Technology (TRT) on the application of formal methods. He obtained his PhD. from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay in 2014 on the subject of formal verification of timed automata and controllers. In 2014, he joined the Critical Embedded Systems Laboratory at TRT to work on the topic of formal verification. His current research focus on model checking at system or implementation levels, numerical accuracy analysis and formal verification of AI-based systems.</em></p>
