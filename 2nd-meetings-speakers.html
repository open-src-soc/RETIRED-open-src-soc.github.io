<h2 id="T-CHAPUT">RISC-V design using Free Open Source Software</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.lip6.fr/actualite/personnes-fiche.php?ident=P109">Jean-Paul Chaput</a></strong>, Roselyne Chotin, Marie-Minerve Louerat, Adrian Satin (<a href="https://www.lip6.fr">LIP6</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/2nd-RISC-V-Meeting-2019-10-01-10h00-Jean-Paul-Chaput.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>This tutorial aims to build a RISC-V processor using only free VLSI CAD tools with a symbolic technology approach (a refined Mead-Conway method as formerly used by MOSIS). The toolchain is currently organised as follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>A design description in VHDL language.</li>
<li>Simulation with GHDL.</li>
<li>Logical synthesis with Yosys. We use a frontend to convert VHDL into Verilog (from Alliance).</li>
<li>Physical design (place &amp; route) using Coriolis.</li>
<li>DRC &amp; LVS using Alliance.</li>
<li>Timing analysis with Tas &amp; Yagle.</li>
<li>Symbolic to real translation (Alliance).</li>
</ol>
<p>Our first objective is to design a RISC-V for AMS 350nm node (c35b4).</p>
<p>The choice of symbolic technology is mainly made for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Node portability. From one symbolic layout, you may target multiple technologies. Only step 7 needs to be done.</li>
<li>Community. Symbolic layout do not contains any NDA related information. As such it can freely be published and shared.</li>
<li>Security. With a published layout, everybody can check that the chip send back from the foundry is exactly what it should be (no hardware trojan).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Jean-Paul Chaput holds a Master Degree in MicroElectronics and Software Engineering. He joined the LIP6 laboratory within SU (formerly UPMC) in 2000. Currently he is a Research Engineer in the Analog and Mixed Signal Team at LIP6. His main focus is on physical level design software. He is a key contributor in developing and maintaining the Alliance &amp; Coriolis VLSI CAD projects for CMOS technologies. In particular he contributed in developing the routers of both Alliance &amp; Coriolis and the whole Coriolis toolchain infrastructure.

<h2 id="K-TAVERNIER">The Momentum and Opportunity of Custom, Open Source Processing</h2>
<p>By <strong>Bertrand Tavernier</strong> (<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/global/innovation/research-and-technology">Thales R&amp;T</a>, <a href="https://riscv.org">The RISC-V Foundation</a>).</p>
<p>The growth of human and business interaction with technology continues to explode. At the literal heart of that technology sits a silicon core, combined with general and specific instructions and connections. The insane cost, risk, development time, necessary volumes, and limited computing demands kept the lucrative chip opportunity within reach of just a handful of companies – focused mostly on general purpose processors. New computing needs in various power and performance dimensions have increased demand and competition for custom processors. This pressure is quietly and rapidly disrupting the processor industry. An Open source approach to processors now reduces risk and investment, with accelerated time to market, and opens the opportunity to thousands of possible custom processors. Learn about the trends, opportunities, and examples – from smart watches to supercomputers – as well as the global momentum of RISC-V!</p>

<h2 id="K-SEZNEC">It's the Instruction Fetch Front-End, Stupid!</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://team.inria.fr/pacap/members/andre-seznec">André Seznec</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/2nd-RISC-V-Meeting-2019-10-02-09h00-Andr%C3%A9-Seznec.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>Achieving high single-thread performance remains a major challenge even in the multicore era. To achieve ultimate single-thread performance, a uniprocessor needs a very efficient memory hierarchy, an aggressive out-of-order execution core and a highly efficient instruction fetch front-end engine.</p>

<h2 id="P-BOL">Ecological transition in ICT: A role for open hardware ?</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/david.bol">David Bol</a></strong> (<a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam/ecs.html">ECS, ICTEAM, UC Louvain</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/2nd-RISC-V-Meeting-2019-10-01-14h30-David-Bol.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>Technological innovation has been fueling our financial economic system focused on growth. It allowed the prosperity of developed countries but also lead to technical obsolescence, accumulation of technologies and life activity acceleration as by-products. Pursuing the exponential economic growth on a finite planet lead us to an environmental crisis whose climate change is the most visible symptom. The emergency we are facing calls for an ecological transition towards more sustainable society and economy based on resource efficiency, sobriety and resilience. In this context, it is important for engineers to critically analyze our technological innovation habits.</p>
<p>This talk gives a provocative personal point of view of innovation habits in the field of information and communication technologies (ICT), where exponential trends (Moore's law, Cooper's law, Koomey's law) define the R&amp;D roadmaps. We will discuss the potential role of open(-source) hardware towards a more sustainable innovation Bio:</p>

<p>We present an instruction-set extension to the open-source RISC-V ISA (RV32IM) dedicated to ultra-low power (ULP) software-defined wireless IoT transceivers. The custom instructions are tailored to the needs of 8/16/32-bit integer complex arithmetic typically required by quadrature modulations. The proposed extension occupies only 3 major opcodes and most instructions are designed to come at a near-zero hardware and energy cost. A functional model of the new architecture is used to evaluate four IoT baseband processing test benches: FSK demodulation, LoRa preamble detection, 32-bit FFT and CORDIC algorithm. Results show an average energy efficiency improvement of more than 35% with up to 50% obtained for the LoRa preamble detection algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="P-GUILLEY">RISC-V ISA: Secure-IC's Trojan Horse to Conquer Security</h2>
<p>By <strong>Rafail Psiakis</strong>, <strong>Baptiste Pecatte</strong> &amp; <a href="https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/guilley">Sylvain Guilley</a> (<a href="http://www.secure-ic.com">Secure IC</a>).</p>
<p>RISC-V is an emerging instruction-set architecture widely used inside plenty of modern embedded SoCs. As the number of commercial vendors adopting this architecture in their products increases, security becomes a priority. In Secure-IC we use RISC-V implementations in many of our products (e.g. PULPino in Securyzr HSM, PicoSoC in Cyber Escort Unit, etc.). The advantage is that they are natively protected against a lot of modern vulnerability exploits (e.g. Specter, Meltdow, ZombieLoad and so on) due to the simplicity of their architecture. For the rest of the vulnerability exploits, Secure-IC crypto-IPs have been implemented around the cores to ensure the authenticity and the confidentiality of the executed code. Due to the fact that RISC-V ISA is open-source, new verification methods can be proposed and evaluated both at the architectural and the micro-architectural level. Secure-IC with its solution named Cyber Escort Unit, verifies the control flow of the code executed on a PicoRV32 core of the PicoSoC system. The community also uses the open-source RISC-V ISA in order to evaluate and test new attacks. In Secure-IC, RISC-V allows us to penetrate into the architecture itself and test new attacks (e.g. sidechannel attacks, Trojan injection, etc.) making it our Trojan horse to conquer security.</p>
<p><em>Rafail Psiakis is currently an R&amp;D Engineer at Secure-IC SAS, Rennes, France working on SW/HW security solutions. He obtained a Ph.D degree in 2018 from University of Rennes.

<p>In this talk I want to open a window into the wonderful world of "alternative" programming languages for RISC-V. What can you get by looking beyond C/C++.</p>
<p>So I will start with a quick introduction to the Ada and SPARK languages, the benefits, the hurdles. I will also present an overview of the applications and domains where they shine, when failure is not an option.</p>
<p>At the end of the talk, I will give my view of the RISC-V architecture and community from the perspective of an alternative languages developer. I will cover the good points, the risks, and provide some ideas on how the RISC-V can keep the door open.</p>

<h2 id="P-CASSE">Verification of SimNML instruction set description using co-simulation</h2>
<p>By <strong>Hugues Cassé</strong>, Emmanuel Caussé, Pascal Sainrat (<a href="https://www.irit.fr/-Equipe-TRACES-?lang=fr">IRIT - Université de Toulouse</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/2nd-RISC-V-Meeting-2019-10-01-17h00-Hugues-Cass%C3%A9.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>The TRACES team at IRIT has developed a description of the RISC-V instruction set in SimNML, which is an Architecture Description Language (ADL). GLISS automatically convert this description into a library supporting, among others, a runnable Instruction Set Simulator.</p>
<p>This presentation exposes the validation of our RISC-V description by parallely running and checking the generated simulator with a different source of execution implementing the RISC-V (different simulator or real microprocessor). This work contributes to the confidence we can have into static analysis tools working on program binary representation.</p>
<p>In such tools, the instruction set support is a boring and error-prone task whose validity is hard to assert. On the opposite, the SimNML description provides a golden model that is easier to write and that can be tested to detect errors. Once a sufficient level of confidence is obtained about the description, it can be processed automatically to derive properties useful for static analyses work.</p>
<p><em>Hugues Cassé is professor-assistant in the University of Toulouse. He performs research on WCET focused on the static analysis of memories and caches and on the value analysis of binary code.

<h2 id="P-SENTIEYS">Fast and Accurate Vulnerability Analysis of a RISC-V Processor</h2>
<p>By Joseph Paturel, Simon Rokicki, Davide Pala, <strong><a href="http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Olivier.Sentieys/">Olivier Sentieys</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/2nd-RISC-V-Meeting-2019-10-01-17h15-Olivier-Sentieys.pdf">slides</a>)</p>
<p>As the RISC-V ISA gains traction in the safety-critical embedded system domain, the development of hardened cores becomes crucial. During this presentation, we present a vulnerability analysis framework that allows for a fast and accurate estimation of processor errors due to transient faults. The proposed set of tools is based on the 32-bit RISC-V core Comet supporting the M extension. The generated hardware's reaction to particle hits is characterized at the gate-level using logic transient pulse width based on physical transistor models. The Comet core being designed at the C level with high-level synthesis tools, a fast, cycle- and bit-accurate simulator can be derived from the core specifications. The previously extracted error patterns are hence re-injected in the core during the execution of applications and the system response is evaluated. This enables the estimation of various vulnerability related metrics and can swiftly drive the core-hardening design process. Results show that the combinational logic needed to implement the M extension plays a non-negligible role in the overall core vulnerability and that multiple-bit upset patterns need to be considered.</p>

<h2 id="P-LEGUAY">Coarse-grained power modelling and estimation using the Hardware Performance Monitors (HPM) of the RISC-V Rocket core</h2>
<p>By <a href="mailto:caaliph.andriamisaina@cea.fr">Caaliph Andriamisaina</a>, <strong><a href="pierre-guillaume.leguay@cea.fr">Pierre-Guillaume Le Guay</a></strong>, (<a href="http://www-list.cea.fr">CEA LIST</a>).</p>
<p>Power consumption monitoring of a processor is important for power management to reduce power usage. Performance counters have been widely used as proxies to estimate processor power online. This work focus on the dynamic power modelling at register-transfer level (RTL) of the RISC-V Rocket core, developed at the University of California, Berkeley. By creating our power model at RTL level, we aim at providing a coarse-grained estimation of power consumption, intended at the early stage of development and for software developers.</p>
<p>The proposed power modelling methodology is based on the Hardware Performance Monitors (HPM) defined in the RISC-V ISA and implemented in the rocket-chip. These HPM monitor different events that take place during instructions execution and reveal several amount of information about power consumption. These events can be the number of cycles, the number of instructions retired, caches misses, etc.</p>

<p>In this presentation, we will discuss about our design and implementation experience with Ara, a vector processor based on RISC-V's Vector Extension. Ara is implemented in GlobalFoundries 22FDX FD-SOI technology. Its latest instance runs at up to 1.2 GHz in nominal conditions, achieving a peak performance of up to 34 DP-GFLOPS and an energy efficiency of up to 67 DP-GFLOPS/W. We will discuss the performance and scalability of Ara, including its limitations under different work loads, and show that the vector processor achieves a high utilization of its functional units, up to 97%, when running a 256x256 matrix multiplication on sixteen lanes. Ara will be released as part of the PULP platform using the same permissive Solderpad license.</p>

<p>By <strong><a href="https://perso.univ-perp.fr/bernard.goossens/">Bernard Goossens</a></strong> &amp; David Parello (<a href="https://webdali.univ-perp.fr">UPVD</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/2nd-RISC-V-Meeting-2019-10-02-10h15-Bernard-Goossens.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>I will introduce the out-of-order RISC-V core (4-stage pipeline: fetch + decode + rename; issue; writeback; commit) that we developed. Everything is written entirely in C under Vivado HLS. The code has been successfully tested on a Pynq card (free development board provided to teacher-researchers upon request to Xilinx, as part of the XUP initiative). This RISC-V core should be understood as a basic kit on which users are invited to add extensions. The RISC-V core does not contain any traditional accelerator for filling the pipeline (eg branch predictor, caches) or floating operators (only the set of 32-bit integer instructions has been implemented). It can serve as a nutshell to add units and measure their effects, for example in the context of educational projects. This RISC-V core is the core brick of the LBP processor, a 64-cores manycore parallelizing processor, under development.</p>

<p>Lightweight manycores differ from other high core count architectures in two major architectural points: they feature a distributed memory memory architecture; and they have their cores grouped into clusters with small amounts of local memory available. Nanvix is general purpose operating system (OS) that we designed from scratch to address this next generation of processors. Our OS features a distributed structure, in which traditional OS functionalities are implemented as system servers; and it aims at a novel distributed paging system to overcome architectural challenges of lightweight manycores. So far, a great effort was made to make Nanvix portable and performant across multiple targets, including industrial processors, such as MPPA (Kalray), and academic lightweight manycores, like those based in OpenRISC (OpTiMSoC) and RISC-V (PULP). Nanvix delivers these features through a rich hardware abstraction layer (HAL), which we shall cover in this talk.

<h2 id="P-DURAND">Enhancing scientific computation using a variable precision FPU with a RISC-V processor</h2>

<p>Scientific computation applications are almost exclusively based on single or double precision floating point formats of the IEEE-754 standard. These formats, of respectively 32 or 64 bits, have a fixed structure, which means that they are unlikely to exactly match the needs of the application. At best, it will be overkill, meaning wasted time, memory and power in computing useless bits. At worst, it will be insufficient, meaning numerically wrong results with possible catastrophic consequences in a world where embedded computing systems interfere more and more with our lives.</p>
<p>We exploit the extensibility of RISC-V for adding support for variable precision floating point operations, and for variable length floating point formats in close memory. In this talk, we discuss the impact of these extensions on the system architecture, at all levels of the computing stack. We propose examples based on linear algebra kernels, which demonstrate the improvements in numerical quality and confidence in the numerical results.</p>

<h2 id="P-PRIKRYL">Enhanced Tools for RISC-V Processor Development and Customization</h2>
<p>By <strong>Zdeněk Přikryl</strong> &amp; Chris Jones (<a href="http://www.codasip.com">Codasip GmbH</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/2nd-RISC-V-Meeting-2019-10-02-15h00-Zden%C4%9Bk-P%C5%99ikryl.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>The emergence of the RISC-V architecture has given rise to a demand for widely differing microarchitectural implementations, ranging from deeply embedded microcontrollers to DSPs and superscalar processors. To meet the challenge of addressing so many different operating points, it is necessary to abstract the (micro)architectural details and automate the generation and verification of RISC-V microprocessors. The Codasip approach to delivering RISC-V processor IPs is to employ the silicon-proven methodology of the high-level CodAL architecture description language and its suite of tools called Studio to implement various RISC-V microarchitectures. Using Codasip Studio (an Eclipse-based integrated processor development environment), designers write a high-level description (in CodAL architecture description language) of a processor and then automatically synthesize the design’s RTL, testbench, virtual platform models, and processor toolchain (C/C++ compiler, debugger, profiler, etc.). Designers can start using the Codasip processor IPs immediately or, as the Codasip processor IPs are described in CodAL, they can extend the ISA in any way, adding a key differentiator or any other secret sauce into their product.</p>

(<a href="./media/slides/2nd-RISC-V-Meeting-2019-10-02-16h00-Sylvain-Boulm%C3%A9.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>The CompCert certified compiler – developed by [<a href="http://compcert.inria.fr/">Xavier Leroy et al. 2006-2018</a>] at Inria – is the first optimizing C compiler with a formal proof of correctness. In particular, it does not have the middle-end bugs usually found in compilers [<a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1993498.1993532">Yang et al. 2011</a>]. It is now used in real-time safety-critical industry [<a href="http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00653367">Bedin França et al. 2012</a>; <a href="http://hal.inria.fr/hal-01643290">Kästner et al. 2018</a>]. It produces assembly code for several processors including RISC-V (32 bit and 64 bit).</p>
<p>This talk will present two backends of CompCert developed at the Verimag Laboratory of Grenoble. The first one – jointly developed with Cyril Six (Kalray-Verimag) and David Monniaux (Verimag) – targets the K1c processor of Kalray. This backend features a (certified) postpass scheduling which optimizes running-times of the produced program by exploiting the instruction-level-parallelism of this VLIW processor.</p>
<p>Our second (more experimental) backend targets the intrinSec processor designed by Olivier Savry et al at LETI. This secure cryptoprocessor extends the RISC-V Instruction Set with instructions and registers for protecting Control-Flow Integrity (CFI). With Paolo Torrini (Verimag), we have modified the RISC-V backend of CompCert in order to include these CFI protections. We are formally proving the functional correctness of this backend.</p>

<h2 id="P-MARCHESE">Complete Formal Verification of RISC-V Cores for Trojan-Free Trusted ICs</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiomarchese">Sergio Marchese</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.onespin.com">OneSpin Solutions</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/2nd-RISC-V-Meeting-2019-10-02-16h15-Sergio-Marchese.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>RISC-V processor IPs are increasingly being integrated into system-on-chip designs for a variety of applications. However, there is still a lack of dedicated functional verification solutions supporting high-integrity, trusted integrated circuits. This presentation examines an efficient, novel, formal-based RISC-V processor verification methodology. The RISC-V ISA is formalized in a set of Operational SystemVerilog assertions. Each assertion is formally verified against the processor’s RTL model. Crucially, the set of assertions is mathematically proven to be complete and free from gaps, thus ensuring that all possible RTL behaviors have been examined. This systematic verification process detects both hardware Trojans and genuine functional errors present in the RTL code. The solution is demonstrated on an open-source RISC-V implementation using a commercially available formal tool, and is arguably a significant improvement to previously published RISC-V ISA verification approaches, advancing hardware assurance and trust of RISC-V designs.</p>
<p><em>Sergio Marchese is technical marketing manager at OneSpin Solutions. He has 20 years of experience in electronic chip design, and deployment of advanced hardware development solutions across Europe, North America, and Asia.

He is passionate about enabling the next generation of high-integrity chips that underpin the Internet of Things, 5G, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles.</em></p>
<h2 id="P-SOULAT">Formal Proof of RISC-V Cores</h2>
<p>By Alexandre Alves, Jimmy Le Rhun, Delphine Longuet and <strong>Romain Soulat</strong> (<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/global/innovation/research-and-technology">Thales R&amp;T</a>).</p>
<p>Formal verification of hardware designs is a classical application of model checking in industry. RISC-V cores can be formally verified for functional correctness and framework already exist to automatically perform that kind of verification. When designs includes safety or security mechanisms, special additional verification requirements can be added to formally verify that those mechanisms performs correctly against threats or feared events.</p>
<p><em>Romain Soulat is working at Thales Research and Technology (TRT) on the application of formal methods. He obtained his PhD. from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay in 2014 on the subject of formal verification of timed automata and controllers. In 2014, he joined the Critical Embedded Systems Laboratory at TRT to work on the topic of formal verification. His current research focus on model checking at system or implementation levels, numerical accuracy analysis and formal verification of AI-based systems.</em></p>
